🧩 LeetCode Daily Practice Tracker
🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Practice Repository — a space where I sharpen my problem-solving mindset through consistent coding challenges.
I aim to master algorithms, analyze complexities, and enhance system design skills using Java, Python, and JavaScript — preparing for the toughest software engineering interviews.

🧠 Core Focus Areas

🧩 Arrays & Strings — mastering traversal, manipulation & pattern finding

🔗 Linked Lists — pointer logic & in-place operations

🧱 Stacks & Queues — LIFO/FIFO problems & monotonic patterns

🔍 Searching & Sorting — efficient algorithms & optimizations

🧮 Dynamic Programming — breaking down overlapping subproblems

🌲 Trees & Graphs — BFS, DFS, recursion & shortest paths

🌀 Sliding Window / Two Pointers — optimizing subarray solutions

⚙️ Bit Manipulation & Math — low-level logic and modular patterns

🎯 My Coding Goals

✅ Solve at least one problem per day
✅ Write optimized and readable code
✅ Practice systematic debugging and test-driven approaches
✅ Build algorithmic templates for reuse
✅ Track progress, patterns, and improvements
